// Package pkg provides package management implementations.
//
// Package management
//
// This library abstracts the details of different package managers in order
// to allow the tool to remain agnostic. Each package manager implementation
// follows a specific contract through the Manager interface.
//
// Usage
//
// Using a package manager instance is as simple as gaining a reference to it,
// via the NewPackageManager method.
//      manager, err := pkg.NewManager(pkg.PackageManagerEopkg)
//
// Placement in the lifecycle
//
// The package manager instance is only called upon after the initial root filesystem
// has been initialised by the Builder. During this time, every method of the API
// will be called.
// Implementations should not expect longevity, as soon as the operation set has
// been completed, the rootfs is then finalized ready for packing in whichever form
// is most appropriate to the builder.

// PackageManager is the type of pkg.Manager that is to be used for packaging
// operations. This type is built-in as there is only a limited set of supported
// package managers at any time.
