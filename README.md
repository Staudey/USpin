Solus image creation utilities. Intended to succeed the existing `solus-image-creator.py` script with something a bit more robust that can construct multiple image types.

Currently the existing image creator can only construct a simple `ISO9660` image, however Solus also makes use of chrootable base images for the `overlayfs` system employed in `evobuild`.
