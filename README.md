Rationale
-------
Intended to succeed the existing `solus-image-creator.py` script with something a bit more robust that can construct multiple image types.

Currently the existing image creator can only construct a simple `ISO9660` image, however Solus also makes use of chrootable base images for the `overlayfs` system employed in `evobuild`.

TODO
----

 - [x] Add parser for the Solus image specification format
 - [x] Port the `Stack` implementation from old image creator
 - [x] Add config format for the main image configuration
 - [x] Add utilities for image format & creation (`dd`/`fallocate`, etc)
 - [x] Implement full `eopkg` support in generic `pkg.Manager` interface
 - [ ] Add basic ISO9660 support once again
 - [ ] Build (successfully!) an existing Solus image specification
 - [ ] Construct specifications for our chroot builder images
 - [ ] Add support for VM/Container images
